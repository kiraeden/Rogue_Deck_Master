To-Do List for Magic Social Site:
	1. Design the Home page
		a. I'm thinking this should include the most ten recent deck list postings for each format
		
	2. Implement the Login system
	
	3. Implement the Collection system
	
	------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Build Notes:
		*I have figured out how to reference decks into a new php document via links into GET requests to deck.php, my next step now is to setup the editing page, using a similar system. I may want to add a link to edit a deck on the view decks page instead of having it be two seperate/repetitive pages.
	
		* My idea for adding a card to a collection is to perform autocomplete using Jquery based on the MTG JSON files available on mtgjson with a single input field accompanied by a numerical entry field, and perform a post request with an "Add" button to the side of the input field.
			*In order for the card to be recognized later if/when I am able to implement the image lookup for cards I may need to verify that the card name input matches a JSON entry via PHP to avoid additional characters being added to a card name.
			*Once I learn enough JS to make the autocomplete feature function, one project will be figuring out how best to lookup images to use for the page. I have solved the image source problem atleast, I can use Gatherer for my image source easily via http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=180607&type=card I just have to modify the multiverseid=#
		*Angular.JS handles form validation (jquery may do this as well, not yet clear) may be important for user login fields later.
		
		*Use jQuery for the autocomplete features, and AJAX to perform an XMLHTTP request to the server to get a more responsive feedback for the collection list as well as adding cards to a collection.
			*I do need to figure out if XML files can actually hold this kind of (potentially) unbounded data, since a collection could be huge, and having a large collection could cause the load times for the XML to be egregious.
			*I can do a similar AJAX call out to compare the XML collection contents to the database contents of a decklist. I may even want to consider storing deck lists in XML instead of SQL for faster lookups, and that would make comparisons between the two more straightforward.
			*Due to the size of the JSON files for all magic cards, it may be necessary to base the autocomplete lookup on just what sets are actually legal in Standard and Modern respectively. For Legacy/Vintage/Casual/Commander, I may need to reduce the full JSON set file to just names for my purposes. I could just write a program to do this for me. To further reduce seek times, I could also split up the files into their first alphabetical characters and have the system only check against the first typed letter.
			
			
		*Okay, so I have the autocomplete functional, the next task, I think, is to create a login system. I think this should come next as most of the items below it depend on it, and while I could rewrite them later, I'd rather not.
		
		*now that I have the PHP version of the card entry sorted out, the next two tasks are to make the data from the deck information form appear in a nicer format above the decklist.
			*After that, I need to make it so that the decklist appears below the card entry field as the user is entering cards. Preferably in the format "Creatures, Lands, Spells, Sideboard"
			
		*SPECIAL NOTE: Creature types such as Enchantment Creature appear together in the type section of the JSON doc, so to make them appear correctly, I may have to do some parsing of the 'types' to check for the Creature type specifically.

	Site Design Notes:
		* For the Home pages, I'm thinking about having links to a standard compendium of deck lists currently running around in the format, and maybe an estimate of their win chance against another deck archetype. 
			*Maybe using metrics such as % of keep-able opening hands, and win percentages against basic archetypes. Something like a one-stop-shop for Format decks and information.
